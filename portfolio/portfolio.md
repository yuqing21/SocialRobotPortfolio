## Group Work

## Case Description

Our project aims to explore the potential applications of the TIAGo robot in simple but essential service tasks. TIAGo is a mobile platform with a manipulator arm featuring limited degrees of freedom, making it suitable for basic navigation and light manipulation tasks rather than highly complex operations.

We propose several use cases for TIAGo in urban and semi-structured environments:

- **Street cleaning and scanning robot**: Performing light street cleaning duties, such as collecting litter or scanning sidewalk conditions, to assist in maintaining public spaces.
- **Indoor delivery assistant**: Transporting lightweight items within hotels, offices, or hospitals — such as delivering packages or small supplies to designated locations.
- **Routine inspection robot**: Conducting scheduled patrols in controlled areas (like hotel lobbies or exhibition centers) to monitor environmental conditions, identify obstacles, or report simple anomalies.

Rather than targeting complex missions like explosive detection, our focus is on feasible and scalable service tasks that align with TIAGo’s physical capabilities. The goal is to design adaptable modules that allow TIAGo to switch between indoor and semi-outdoor roles, enhancing its overall utility.

## Reflections

### How is Design Research linked to HRI
> Design research optimizes the interaction experience between humans and robots by understanding user needs. Applying design research in HRI can help robots integrate more naturally into the human environment and improve communication efficiency and emotional identification.

### Digital (AI) vs Embodiment
> In class, Edwin brought us several companion little robots, there are small robot on a roller who will make nonverbal noises, desk robot that will wave and talk to you, and one to my best interst, robot cats that have close-to-reality fur, gesture, and can even "purr" like real cats. Among these different forms of social robots, the tension between "digitalization" (AI) and "embodiment"  is particularly evident.

First, small roller robots mainly rely on sound and light effects to interact with people. Their "bodies" are very simplified and play more of a role as sound and signal transmitters, lacking real touch and form. Although these robots can attract attention visually and sound prompts can help create a sense of companionship, it is difficult to form a deep connection with users on an emotional level because their "bodies" cannot convey real pressure, temperature or softness.

In contrast, desktop robots are richer in shape and action design. They can not only wave and nod, but also make simple language similar to intonation, which brings a higher anthropomorphic experience in social interaction. However, their rigid plastic shells and mechanical joints still make people aware of their inanimate nature at all times - when you reach out to touch them, the cold material and mechanical stiffness remind you that this is a machine, not a breathing companion.

The robot cat with simulated fur and "purring" sounds represents a peak attempt at embodied social robots. The realistic touch and sound make people almost forget that it is a programmed product; when you stroke its back, you can feel the subtle resistance of the soft "fur" sliding with your fingers, and after hearing the "purring", you will unconsciously feel the warm attachment to a real pet cat. This highly embodied design allows AI's digital intelligence and physical form to be deeply integrated, ultimately blurring the boundaries between people and objects, making it easier for users to psychologically produce "pseudo-social bias" (social presence), and even treat it as a real social partner.

Through this classroom experience, I realized that if social robots want to go beyond the role of "tools", they must be sufficiently "humanized" and "pseudo-life" in both AI algorithms (digital interaction) and hardware forms (body perception) - not only can they understand and respond, but they must also have a real "touch". If future designs can incorporate tactile feedback, temperature simulation, and even micro-expression changes, then social robots will be more likely to become “emotional partners” in our daily lives rather than just cold machines that make sounds or movements.

### Why is 'HER' (not) a Compelling Argument?
> "Her" is a convincing film that shows the possibility of a deep emotional connection between humans and AI. However, the AI in the film has no entity, ignoring the important role of embodiment in establishing emotions, so it also has limitations..
